# PCF FluentUI Autocomple Boilerplate.

Dynamics365 / PowerApps PCF Control boilerplate to create a Dynamics lookup from an api source. This is a boilerplate only and you will need to edit the api endpoint to a data point of you choosing.  The API I have used in this example will need an api key before it will work, but this is designed to give you an example.

The object of the project was to have a dynamics api lookup built on React and is styled to replicate out of the box components from Microsoft. 

This example has alot of console.debug value being pumped out, feel free to remove these fore your production component.
