# PCF FluentUI Autocomple Boilerplate.

Dynamics365 / PowerApps PCF Control boilerplate to create a Dynamics lookup from an api source. This is a boilerplate only and you will need to edit the api endpoint to a data point of you choosing.  The API I have used in this example you will need an api key, before it wil work, but this is designed to give you an example.
